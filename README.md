**Carseat** is a green platform for connecting travelers with open seats in cars. Travelers can efficiently search the ride database by location, date, pickup time, and cost. Drivers can post rides, specifying details such as drop-off and pickup-points, seats available, space for luggage, cost, and flexibility on pick-up time and detours. A request system allows drivers to approve travelers for their trip.
